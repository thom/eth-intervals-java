"""
columnize header_name*

Given input data that is a flat list of measurements, groups them into
N columns where N is the number of header_names provided on the
command line.  Assumes that the first X measurements correspond to the
first header, the next X to the second header, and so on.  X is
determined by taking the total number of measurements and dividing by
the number of headers.  Prints out in tab-separated format suitable for
opening by a spreadsheet.

Used when doing benchmarks: simply iterate over the versions you want to
test and emit the test numbers for each version, then run this script
to collate them.

For nice ASCII output, pipe the toutput into the lineup script.
