# Java implementation of Intervals

Intervals are a new, higher-level primitive for parallel programming allowing programmers to directly construct the program 
schedule. They were developed at ETH ZÃ¼rich as part of the PhD research of Nicholas D. Matsakis and are the subject of my 
master's thesis.
